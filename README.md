# OmniAuth Foursquare

This gem contains the Foursquare strategy for OmniAuth.

Foursquare uses the OAuth2 flow, you can read about it here: https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/oauth.html

## How To Use It

So let's say you're using Rails, you need to add the strategy to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'omniauth-foursquare'

You can pull them in directly from github e.g.:

    gem 'omniauth-foursquare', :git => 'https://github.com/arunagw/omniauth-foursquare.git'

Once these are in, you need to add the following to your `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :foursquare, "consumer_key", "consumer_secret"
    end

You will obviously have to put in your key and secret, which you get when you register your app with Foursquare (they call them API Key and Secret Key).

Now just follow the README at: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth

## Supported Rubies

OmniAuth Foursquare is tested under 1.8.7, 1.9.2, 1.9.3, 2.x and Ruby Enterprise Edition.
